        <div class="txt-3">Dear Mr. Devaney:</div>
        <p>2/22/2011</p>
        <p class="margin-top">I write this letter as a new customer to Hughes Oil and wanted to share with you the outstanding assistance I have received from several members of your team.  Too often customers write or call only to complain rather than to acknowledge truly outstanding service when it is received. </p>
        <p class="margin-top">As a new customer, I bought a home with a new heating system that had been installed by Hughes Oil under a previous owner.  There were some complications with the integration of a new burner and an old duct hot air system which was causing considerable noise when the system was turned on or shut down. </p>
        <p class="margin-top">Though I was inclined to work with one of your competitors who I have personally known, I was encouraged by Bob Starr to give your company the opportunity to make the necessary adjustments and to join up as a new customer.  He assured me that I would see the results I needed.  I took Bob on his word and proceeded to sign up as a new customer. Along with Rich Horan they worked with me to schedule the work at times convenient to my schedule and also took a personal interest in getting the repairs done timely.  They arranged for two others on your staff to come to my home and diagnose the problem and proceed with a plan of action to fix the problem.</p>
        <p class="margin-top">These two employees were Glenn Cosgro and Cliff Cheney (spelled like the former Vice-President as he likes to say). Both gentlemen made a concerted effort to diagnose and repair the system. Through their skilled effort and commitment to quality, I am happy to report that the air system is as quiet as a church mouse. To say that they did an excellent job would be an understatement. The efforts of Mr. Cosgro and Mr. Cheney went beyond just good workmanship. They were highly professional but also just kind and friendly. That is a unique quality in todayâ€™s world and you are very fortunate to have them in your employ. </p>
        <p class="margin-top">The work of Bob Starr, Rich Horan, Glenn Cosgro and Cliff Cheney reflected well on your company, especially for a new customer without knowledge of your company. They are a great team. </p>
        <p class="margin-top">I want to thank them but sharing with you the truly excellent service I received from each of them and will be happy to share the good news with my friends and colleagues who are looking for a truly reputable oil company. </p>
        <p class="margin-top">With best wishes, I remain,</p>
        <p class="margin-top">Sincerely,</p>

        <div class="txt-3">Dear Lisa,</div>
        <p class="margin-top">9/20/2010</p>
        <p class="margin-top">Thank you for your phone call in reference to the installation of the new boiler for the second floor apartment of my house.  It was nice of you to follow up to see how the installation went and if I had any problems or questions concerning it.  It turned out to be a very pleasant experience.  Your staff was extremely professional and well mannered.  They were respectful of my property and possessions that were stored in the basement.  They answered any questions that I had about what they were going to do and how they were going to do it.  I was very comfortable with them working in my house.  After they finished, the men did an incredible job cleaning up.  I am looking forward to doing future business with the Devaney Fuel Company.  I wished that I had changed over to your company a lot sooner.  It would have saved me an incredible amount of aggravation and expense.  Again, thank you for everything.</p>
        <p class="margin-top">Yours Truly,</p>

        <div class="txt-3">Hi Lisa,</div>
        <p>10/6/2010</p>
        <p class="margin-top">"We are so happy with James Devaney Fuel!  Now on our second home with James Devaney as our fuel company, we are even more convinced we made the right decision to switch from a local competitor. Having just moved to an older home that needed a new heating system, we relied on James Devaney for all the work. During the initial stages, Greg came to our home more than once to discuss our options and determine, based on the size of our home, what system would be best suited.  He also stopped by on the actual installation day to check in with the installation crew and troubleshoot a small issue regarding the location of our AC condensing unit. Greg has been reliable and committed, and wonderful to work with. The installation crew, Sal and Derek, were great too. They were knowledgeable about our new system, hardworking, and easy going. I found them trustworthy as well. I had to leave several times to pick up and drop of my kids, and felt comfortable leaving them in my home. We are thrilled with our new system and even more so with the service we received.</p>
        <p class="margin-top">We also appreciate Credit Services!  Janet helped us find a manageable fuel budget which, in today's economy, is a really nice break.</p>					
        <p class="margin-top">We've had nothing short of excellence from James Devaney and how very refreshing to find a company that still believes in, and actually delivers, quality customer service."</p>

        <div class="txt-3">Dear Mr. Devaney,</div>
        <p>9/25/2010</p>
        <p class="margin-top">It is about four weeks since I departed from Lexington, MA and settled down amidst the corn fields in Iowa. Time for reflection.</p>					
        <p class="margin-top">My first experience with JDF started in August 2006. John Holmes was my first interface with your company. Prompt, polite and perfect in execution. I spoke to him at least once during each of the four years that I dealt with JDF, and he showed admirable qualities to get things done. After 30 plus years with Minuteman, JDF was a breath of fresh air for folks like us.</p>					
        <p class="margin-top">The service department of JDF is absolutely superb. Indeed, a 24/7 operation that is at the beck and call of customers. Never a disappointment. I liked John Grasso's work ethic and always requested that he should come over and take care of the annual boiler tune up + maintenance.</p>					
        <p class="margin-top">In November 2009, I installed a new boiler and tank with a view to preparing the house for sale in 2010. I got an excellent recommendation from Bud Wodarski to entrust the underground tank removal work to DB Environmental Services. DB also installed the new tank in the house. Then came the masterpiece installation work of the new boiler by the Devaney crew. I took photos of the new boiler + the copper piping work surrounding the boiler and emailed them to friends and relatives across the globe. It invited admiration and observation from friends near and far.</p>					
        <p class="margin-top">I can end this note only after bringing up the name of Jean Scagnoli. I think of Fidelity Investments when I look back at my dealings with JDF. You have well trained people in every section of the company. That is why all gears function efficiently. Jean promptly stepped up to the plate in July 2010 and sorted out some small issues in the billing area.</p>					
        <p class="margin-top">My sincere thanks to the entire gang at James Devaney Fuel Co. for doing a sincere job day in and day out.</p> Kind regards,

        <div class="txt-3">Dear Bill,</div>
        <p class="margin-top">We would like to acknowledge the outstanding service provided by your team in connection with the installation of the Unico central air conditioning system.</p>
        <p class="margin-top">From the initial meeting with Rick Aprea and subsequent meeting with you and Rick, through the installation provided by Jim Devaney, Ken Richard and your son, the team demonstrated the utmost in professionalism. Throughout the process both Jim and Ken were always available to answer questions and performed their work in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, your associate Kevin McKeown did an excellent job in providing electrical services.</p>
        <p class="margin-top">We look forward to enjoying a cool and comfortable summer.</p>
        <p class="margin-top">Sincerely,</p>

        <div class="txt-3">Here's a letter we received from the Albert Corporation...</div>
        <p class="margin-top">More than 15 of our properties are serviced by James Devaney Fuel Company. They have a fantastic service department and a very knowledgeable installation department. Their rapid, capable responses to our requests make our job as property managers much easier during the heating season.</p>
